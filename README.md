# EPITA_Event_management
This is the android application which is mainly built to handle the events happening in school or universities.

The spectrum used for the review of literature focuses on the definition of events, quality, and managing the events of the EPITA school. An event can be defined as a public assembly for the purpose of celebration, education, marketing, gaming, conference, tradeshows, festivals, or reunion. Events can be classified based on their size, type, and context. An education or career event like an education fair, job fair, workshop, seminar, debate, conference, contest, competition, etc. The quality of service provided is dependent upon many parameters which should answer the question “Is this good enough and why should I use it?”
