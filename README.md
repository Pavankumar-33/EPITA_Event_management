# EPITA_Event_management
This is the android application which is mainly built to handle the events happening in school or universities.

The spectrum used for the review of literature focuses on the definition of events, quality, and managing the events of the EPITA school. An event can be defined as a public assembly for the purpose of celebration, education, marketing, gaming, conference, tradeshows, festivals, or reunion. Events can be classified based on their size, type, and context. An education or career event like an education fair, job fair, workshop, seminar, debate, conference, contest, competition, etc. The quality of service provided is dependent upon many parameters which should answer the question “Is this good enough and why should I use it?”

# Technology used

The proposed system is an Android app designed to manage and coordinate social activities held at EPITA by the students or staff. In this project, we will create an application that manages events and streamlines the conventional approach to event planning. 
 
The fact that the application is used on an Android mobile enhances connectivity between participants and coordinators, resulting in an overall more transparent system for the institution. Along with improving connection, our application also significantly reduces the amount of paper that would otherwise be required for everyday operations in EPITA. It is a practical tool that all students or staff can use on an Android mobile device at anytime, anywhere. 
 
The technologies we used to develop the application are listed below:  
 
•	Kotlin: It is a popular open-source programming language developed by JetBrains that can be used to create Android applications. 
 
•	Firebase database: it is a NoSQL database hosted in the cloud that allows us to store and synchronize user’s and events related data in real-time. 
 
•	Android studio: Android Studio, which is based on IntelliJ IDEA, is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development. 
 
•	XML: Extensible Markup Language, abbreviated XML, is a markup language like HTML that is used to describe data. Essentially, XML tags are not predefined. The tags must be implemented and defined in XML. XML tags define data and are used to store and organize information. It is easily scalable and easy to create. We used XML to implement UI-related data, which is a lightweight markup language that does not make layout heavy.
